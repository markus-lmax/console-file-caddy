<p>A plugin to convert console output into navigable links for absolute paths, <code>file://</code>, <code>fqn://</code>
and <code>diff://</code> URIs, with optional <code>#line:column</code> references to specify the line and column
location in the editor.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Absolute paths in the form: <code>/...../some-file.ext:xxx</code> on OS X/Unix systems and
    <code>x:\....\some-file.ext:xxx</code> or <code>x:/..../some-file.ext:xxx</code> on Windows systems, where <code>xxx</code> is
    line/column information, will be converted into links.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>fqn://</code> protocol followed by a language specific fully qualified class name and optional line
    and column information. This link only requires a fully qualified class name which is
    independent of the physical location of the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>diff://</code> protocol followed by two file paths as <code>/somePath/...../file1.ext:xxx ? /someOtherPath/file2.ext:xxx &amp;</code> to be opened in the IDE difference view with each file&rsquo;s caret
    to be located at the optional coordinates given by <code>xxx</code>. To prevent other console filters
    from hijacking the individual paths as links to single files, the file paths can be optionally
    wrapped in <code>[]</code> after the first <code>/</code>, as:
    <code>diff:///[somePath/...../file1.ext:xxx]?/[someOtherPath/file2.ext:xxx]&amp;</code>. Spaces around <code>?</code>
    and the terminating <code>&amp;</code> are optional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin is liberal in recognizing the line/column suffix with <code>yyy</code> being line number and
<code>xxx</code> column and will accept <code>#Lyyy</code>, <code>:yyy:xxx</code>, <code>(yyy:xxx)</code>, <code>[yyy-xxx]</code> and their
permutations.</p>
<p><code>diff://</code> links allow creating output with integrated difference links similar to test console
output in IntelliJ for test failure. It allows creating these links in test frameworks not
recognized by the IDE or where the IDE does not have the facility to easily show difference view
for files.</p>
<p><code>fqn://</code> links are for generating links in test output with only the class name to specify the
file location. This includes parameterized tests with <code>assertXXX(message, expected, actual)</code>
assertions. Adding an <code>fqn://</code> reference for the file/line/column of the source of the test
parameter data to create a navigable link to the line of the failed parameter data, instead of
the test source. See <a href="https://github.com/vsch/console-file-caddy/blob/master/README.md">README</a></p>
