<p>Converts absolute file paths with optional line/column information in the console output to
navigable links to files.</p>
<p>Paths in the form: <code>/...../some-file.ext:xxx</code> on OS X/Unix systems and
<code>x:\....\some-file.ext:xxx</code> or <code>x:/..../some-file.ext:xxx</code> on Windows systems will be converted.</p>
<p>The plugin is liberal in recognizing the suffix with <code>yyy</code> being line number and <code>xxx</code> column
and will accept <code>#Lyyy</code>, <code>:yyy:xxx</code>, <code>(yyy:xxx)</code>, <code>[yyy-xxx]</code> and their permutations.</p>
<p>Useful for any console application which outputs absolute file path and line information as part
of its operation. For example Scala sbt will output warnings with file/line information which
this plugin will convert to navigable link right to the file/line.</p>
<p>It will also recognize <code>fqn://</code> protocol followed by a language specific fully qualified class
name and optional line and column information. This link only requires a fully qualified class
name which is independent of the physical location of the project.</p>
<p>This makes it useful for generating links from tests including parameterized tests with
<code>assertXXX(message, expected, actual)</code> assertions. If message contains the file/line/column of
the source for the test parameter data then a failed test will have a navigable link. See
